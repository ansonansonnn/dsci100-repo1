    "4. Methods and Plan\n",
    "- The one method that I am going to use to answer my question of whether age can be used to determine the hours played is linear regression. I am using linear regression. I am using linear regression because as I explored different visualizations of my data, I failed to find any linearity. Also, since I have some sparse, isolated, data points, KNN regression would be very inaccurate especially with predictions away from the main clump of data points. However, I can compare RMSE and RMPSE to truly figure out which one is better. The good thing about this method is that there aren't really any huge assumptions that I need to make. I will only use rows of data with both an age and hours played value, using na.rm = true to filter out any possible NA's. One potential weakness is that linear regression assumes that my data is a straight line relationship, however we know that is not the case. For my data, I am going to isolate the Age and hours_played variables. I will split it with 75% going to training and 25% to testing. Overall, I feel like these steps will set me up for success. "
